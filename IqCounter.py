I know my number. Its a nice number. But it doesn't mean anything. My parents had me tested as a teen because they thought I was handicapped (poor school performance). I was tested in a clinic. They results were great, but the end-results were not the best. It went to my head, and I cared even less about proving myself. I think knowing this number begat more negative effects than not knowing. And I'm not even impervious to my own stupidity. Bug number, still big dummy.

Don't trust people who only took online tests (the real test was actually pretty hands-on), and NEVER trust someone who cannot display humility.

Glad you got the ref. I also found this, which you may find interesting and less prone to survivorship bias than asking for IQ scores in the INTJ sub. I'm not aware of the existence of other similar studies. Sad they didn't use the WAIS or a more established psychometric battery, although it correlates fairly highly with it. https://sci.bban.top/pdf/10.1177/1073191196003003004.pdf

I‚Äôm smarter than the average bear‚Ä¶ but also the type to miss a street sign while mentally solving an investigation or reverse-engineering someone‚Äôs motive.

I do know my IQ, and yeah, it‚Äôs above average, but that number doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. IQ tests capture logical and verbal intelligence, maybe a bit of spatial reasoning, but that‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt measure intuition, insight, behavioral pattern recognition, or metacognition.

There are at least eight types of intelligence. I can write essays (linguistic), analyze behavior (intrapersonal), detect micro-patterns (logical-mathematical), and mentally construct systems (spatial). But ask me to interpret a social cue in real time (interpersonal), complete a hands-on craft (bodily-kinesthetic), or solve something practical in the moment (practical intelligence), and I‚Äôll short-circuit.

So yes, INTJs tend to test well. But intelligence is much bigger than a number. It‚Äôs knowing where it excels, where it falls short, and having the clarity to work with both.

Suggestion: make this a poll. Then people don‚Äôt have to answer with their specific score since many seem hesitant. Including me.

I took it in high school on the recommendation of a g&t teacher. I scored well.

My takeaways from the exam were (as a high school student):

I don‚Äôt understand how spatial abilities points to intelligence.

Picture and word comparisons seem significantly based on culture.

It just didn‚Äôt seem fair.

Shortly after I read Daniel Goldman‚Äôs work on Emotional Intelligence and lost faith of IQ testing.

146 but I'm not too invested in it. The only thing it really helps with is explaining the communication gap between me and average person. Supposedly, your communication range is plus or minus 20 points from your own iq.

In the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter because it‚Äôs just a number that‚Äôs influenced by your surroundings, mood, state of mind (level of clarity), your diet for the day, etc. all these things can and will impact your IQ score on a test, as well as the type of test.

But if you want the number, then take the test. Just don‚Äôt openly share the number with people, because it can make them feel inferior if they test lower or start questioning themselves. (And yes, I do know my IQ range. My peers all recognize there‚Äôs a ton of raw brain power ‚Äî they just don‚Äôt need to know how much üòâ)

2 of the readily accepted current versions of mainstream comprehensive tests pegged me around 140 when I was in my late 20s.

Therapist was working through options to explain my thought patterns, being socially withdrawn/dismissive/disinterested, and being so generally distrusting of everybody and everything..

Once the high IQ and INTJ personality was revealed.. they quickly pushed me off to somebody they believed could work with me.

A few months later, I figured out that I was paying them $70 an hour to be their therapist.. and getting nothing in return.

20 years later.. nothing has changed. Abysmal social skills.. but, you definitely want me on your team for the trivia competition. I got the memory- retention-for-obscure-information gene instead of the patience-and-charisma gene.

I instantly recognize the intent and call people out on their pretentiousness or manipulation.. and they despise me for it.

Being intelligent is a curse.

High enough that even when I'm pressured to answer that question I still get insulted for saying.

Related to intuition, as far as the Jung/MBTI stuff goes. Related to openness and trait curiosity in practical psych.

I maxed those traits when evaluated.

People who are into MBTI (myself included) have a really hard time classifying me because I display the traits of both INTJ and INFJ pretty dang thoroughly.

I lean towards INTJ, I think; but I don't know or care all that much. Introspection seems to be one of those things that produces diminishing returns. I'm still learning to practice moderation, but I'm learning pretty fast that inspecting others so you can meet their needs is way more productive in ways we don't pay enough attention to.

Hope that answers your real question. üçªüïäÔ∏èüëçüèΩ

I've consistently tested around three standard deviations above the mean but I am beginning to suspect it is going up considering the likely impacts of the rising popularity of tiktok/reel video style media consumption combined with the trend of people outsourcing even simple intellectual loads to LLMs. 

Still, take IQ scores with a big fat grain of salt because they measure IQ, not intelligence per se.

Top 2% but it only matters in terms of predicting future success, and tends not to change after age 18, so at this point in my life it is irrelevant. The question should be what are you doing with your number, not what is your number.

I'm good at language, logic, observation and forming patterns or deduction. I suck at math and I might not deliver reliably similar results each time. And the test didn't even measure everything I'm good at or how I interact with others. This in mind, I don't care that I once got overly optimistic number as result, I might not be at same mood and headspace or nutritional status again. Might have worse, or better.

132 from a legit tester when I was young (though my mom only told me the results a few years ago, she has the pictures). Willing to do it again due to a bet between my wife and I lmao... but I am too lazy to go to a site for it. It seems fun though!

If anyone knows an online one that is legit. I am willing to compete with my wife on it hahaha

I don‚Äôt know for sure because I haven‚Äôt had a psychologist do a proper evaluation. Because it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

The Mensa online test puts me in the high 130s, for what it‚Äôs worth.

I haven't checked since I got my TBI in the military. Before that I scored 156. I think I became a marine to become less intelligent and feel normal though.

NGL, I found the test pointless. Classifying people by math logic when the world runs on common sense and emotions makes me go "WTF, how is this useful irl?"

I was in the top percentile in multiple things, including mathematics against all 11th grade students in a state with good math scores and a practice IQ thing that they asked a few students to do. But I didn't care about that at all, and I still don't.

If you can practice and study for an intelligence test, then it isn't an intelligence test. But when I was writing a paper on education and the different types of intelligence, I took an enormous amount of open-source testing. I have a low verbal IQ relative to my other areas but am extremely high in others. I particularly don't like the label and prejudice that would come with it. There are people who obsess over their IQ scores, and those people aren't intelligent in the way that matters.

Pairing my DNA with others, I share DNA with others that have "more persistent brain arousal," "stronger memory performance," "likely to exhibit high levels of cognitive dissonance tolerance," "highly adept at pattern recognition," "unlikely to display emotional intelligence," "likely to have higher white matter integrity," "likely to show higher static spatial working memory," "high working memory," "likely to show higher figural fluency," and am "less likely to remember negative or positive interactions."

The rest of them are in the mid category. Except for creativity, and the ability to focus.

Of coure you are going to get only high iq anwers here. No one is gonna brag about an average or below average iq. Therefore this question is meaningless if you want to determine how smart INTJs are on average.

It's been almost 20 years. So the number is way outdated now. What was a good score years ago might be average now.

But ultimately, pattern recognition and memorization skills dont really define intelligence to me. I've have the pleasure to meet people with downs that taught me amazing things and met plenty of doctors in their respective fields of study that didnt seem to know anything else about anything.

Interesting. I think someone else pointed it out but be sure not to fall into selection bias op. I haven't seen a single person report an iq below 100 which is statistically very unlikely if the selection is a true representation of the population given the sample size of 30 or so reports. People are far less likely to answer this question if they have a poor result.

To get a true population read it would be better to select at random people in r/intj and then Dm or message them to get their iq results. I'm going to check out the paper another commentor shared.

My sister ordered me a MENSA test a long time ago when I was in my early 20s. I received my results in the mail, and my score was 143. I told everyone I scored a 95. I don‚Äôt like any special attention, and didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal of it. Thirty years later, most days, 95 feels about spot on. ü§£

Unless everyone here took the same, standardised IQ test, comparing numbers is not very informative.

Do online tests really count? I took one some years ago and I scared 131 (but it was not in my native language, so I guess that could affect the result). Also, I've gotten more st*p¬°d over the years lol

I forgot what it was but it was higher than my expectations. It didn't change that I still think I'm dumber than the next person. It is kind of nice though when I surprise someone with what I know or can figure out that helps them just because for me it's just random facts or just because I chalk it up to "fresh eyes" or something.

I work retail currently, going back to school within the next year cause I'm finally stable, and every so often dealing with customers is also a reminder too that I am not as dumb I constantly believe I am.
